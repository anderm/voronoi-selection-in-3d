## Scripts that leverage HoloLens input features namely Gaze, Gesture and Voice.

This contains a fully-featured **input module**, which allows you to handle various types of input and send them to any game object being currently gazed at, or any fallback object. It also includes a **cursor** similar to the HoloLens shell cursor that fully leverages the Unity's animation system.

### Input Module Design
The input module is designed to be extensible: it could support various input mechanisms and various types of gazers.

Each input source (hands, gestures, others) implement a **IInputSource** interface. The interface defines various events that the input sources can trigger. The input sources register themselves with the InputManager, whose role it is to forward input to the appropriate game objects. Input sources can be dynamically enabled / disabled as necessary, and new input sources can be created to support different input devices.

Game objects that want to consume input events can implement one or many **input interfaces**, such as:

- **IFocusable** for focus enter and exit. The focus can be triggered by the user's gaze or any other gaze source.
- **IHoldHandle** for the Windows hold gesture.
- **IInputHandler** for source up and down. The source can be a hand that tapped, a clicker that was pressed, etc.
- **IInputClickHandler** for source clicked. The source can be a hand that tapped, a clicker that was pressed, etc.
- **IManipulationHandler** for the Windows manipulation gesture.
- **INavigationnHandler** for the Windows navigation gesture.
- **ISourceStateHandler** for the source detected and source lost events.
- **ISpeechHandler** for voice commands.
- **IDictationHandler** for speech to text dictation.

The **input manager** listens to the various events coming from the input sources, and also takes into account the gaze. Currently, that gaze is always coming from the GazeManager class, but this could be extended to support multiple gaze sources if the need arises.

By default, input events are sent to the currently focused game object, if that object implements the appropriate interface. Modals input handlers can also be added to the input manager: these modal handlers will take priority over the currently focused object Fallback handlers can also be defined, so that the application can react to global inputs that aren't targeting a specific element. Any event sent by the input manager always bubbles up from the object to its ancestors. 

In recap, the input manager forwards the various input sources events to the appropriate game object, using the following order:

1. The registered modal input handlers, in LIFO (Last-In First-Out) order of registration
2. The currently focused object
3. The fallback input handlers, in LIFO order of registration

This also includes a fake input source that allows you to simulate hand input when in the editor. By default, this can be done by holding Shift (left hand) or Space (right hand), moving the mouse to move the hand and use the left mouse button to tap.

### [Scripts](Scripts)
Scripts related to the input features.

#### Cursor
##### AnimatedCursor.cs
Animated cursor is a cursor driven using an animator to inject state information and animate accordingly.

##### Cursor.cs
Abstract class that a concrete class should implement to make it easy to create a custom cursor. This provides the basic logic to show a cursor at the location a user is gazing.
1. Decides when to show the cursor.
2. Positions the cursor at the gazed hit location.
3. Rotates the cursor to match hologram normals.

##### CursorModifier.cs
CursorModifier is a component that can be added to any game object with a collider to modify how a cursor reacts when on that collider.

##### ICursor.cs
Cursor interface that any cursor must implement.

##### ICursorModifier.cs
Interface that any cursor modifier must implement to provide basic overrides for cursor behaviour.

##### MeshCursor.cs
Cursor whose states are represented by one or many meshes.

##### ObjectCursor.cs
Cursor whose states are represented by one or many game objects.

##### SpriteCursor.cs
Cursor whose states are represented by colored sprites.

#### Gaze
##### BaseRayStabilizer.cs
A base abstract class for a stabilizer that takes as input position and orientation, and performs operations on them to stabilize or smooth that data.

##### GazeManager.cs
Singleton component in charge of managing the gaze vector. This is where you can define which layers are considered when gazing at objects. Optionally, the gaze manager can reference a ray stabilizer that will be used to stabilize the gaze of the user.

- **MaxGazeCollisionDistance :** the maximum distance to raycast. Any holograms beyond this value will not be raycasted to.
- **RaycastLayers :** the Unity layers to raycast against. If you have holograms that should not be raycasted against, like a cursor, do not include their layers in this mask.
- **Stabilizer :** stabilizer to use to stabilize the gaze. If not set, the gaze will not be stabilized.
- **Gaze Transform :** the transform to use as the source of the gaze. If not set, will default to the main camera.

##### GazeStabilizer.cs
Stabilize the user's gaze to account for head jitter.

- **StoredStabilitySamples** Number of samples that you want to iterate on.  A larger number will be more stable.

#### Microphone

##### MicStream.cs
Lets you access beam-formed microphone streams from the HoloLens to optimize voice and/or room captures, which is impossible to do with Unity's Microphone object. Takes the data and inserts it into Unity's AudioSource object for easy handling. Also lets you record indeterminate-length audio files from the Microphone to your device's Music Library, also using beam-forming.

Check out Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Tests/Scripts/MicStreamDemo.cs for an example of implementing these features, which is used in the demo scene at Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Tests/MicrophoneStream.unity.

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure to add the Microphone and Music Library capabilities in your app, in Unity under  
Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Settings for Windows Store -> Publishing Settings -> Capabilities  
or in your Visual Studio Package.appxmanifest capabilities.

**_KeywordsAndResponses_** Set the size as the number of keywords you'd like to listen for, then specify the keywords and method responses to complete the array.

**RecognizerStart** Set this to determine whether the keyword recognizer will start immediately or if it should wait for your code to tell it to start.

#### Voice

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure to add the Microphone capabilities in your app, in Unity under  
Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Settings for Windows Store -> Publishing Settings -> Capabilities  
or in your Visual Studio Package.appxmanifest capabilities.

##### KeywordManager.cs (_Depreciated_)
Please use SpeechInputSource and SpeechInputHandler instead.

Used to assign a Unity Event to a keyword stored in the SpeechInputSource component.

##### ISpeechHandler.cs
Interface that a game object can implement to react to speech keywords.

##### DictationInputManager.cs
Singleton class that implements  the DictationRecognizer to convert the user's speech to text. The DictationRecognizer exposes dictation functionality and supports registering and listening for hypothesis and phrase completed events.

- **InitialSilenceTimeout** :  The time length in seconds before dictation recognizer session ends due to lack of audio input in case there was no audio heard in the current session.
- **AutoSilenceTimeout** : The time length in seconds before dictation recognizer session ends due to lack of audio input.
- **RecordingTime** : Length in seconds for the manager to listen.

1. Select whether you want the recognizer to start automatically or when you manually start it.
2. Specify the number of keywords you want.
3. Type the word or phrase you'd like to register as the keyword and, if you want, set a key code to use in the Editor. You can also use an attached microphone with the Editor.
4. Press the + to add a response. Then, drag a GameObject with the script you want to call into the "None (Object)" field.
5. Select the script and method to call or variable to set from the "No Function" dropdown. Add any parameters, if necessary, into the field below the dropdown.

When you start the scene, your keywords will automatically be registered on a KeywordRecognizer, and the recognizer will be started (or not) based on your Recognizer Start setting.

#### ManualCameraControl.unity

This scene shows how to manually control the camera.  The script is on the main camera of the scene.  When preview mode in Unity is activated, the user can move around the scene using WASD and look around using right-mouse-button + mouse. 

#### MicrophoneStream.unity
Example usage of MicStream.cs to select and record beam-formed audio from the hololens. In editor, the script lets you choose if you want to beam-form capture on voice or on the room. When running, press 'Q' to start the stream you selected, 'W' will stop the stream, 'A' starts recording a wav file, and 'S' stops the recording, saves it to your Music library, and prints the full path of the audio clip.

#### SelectedObjectKeywords.unity
Example on how to send keyword messages to currently selected dynamically instantiated object.
Gazing on an object and saying "Select Object" will persistently select that object for interaction with voice commands,
after which the user can also adjust object size with "Make Smaller" and "Make Bigger" voice commands and finally clear
currently selected object by saying "Clear Selection".
